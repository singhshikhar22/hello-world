# hello-world
this is just a testing repository
this is my first repository on github and the testings are just going on 
this is also telling me about how the branches are and what are their functions 
also how to create a new branch that is the copy of the master branch
then make edits and then commits
commits are basically the changes that made in the copy of master branch
also each commit is associated with a commit message that is a just a note to describe why the changes are made.
